              <h2>I deleted my Facebook account</h2>
            </div>
            I (or <b>Luke Guerdan</b>, if you are searching for me)
            deleted my Facebook and Instagram accounts. Naturally, you might be
            wondering why I did this and how to stay in touch. 
            <br><br>
            I put together this page to answer any questions and share how to stay
            connected :)
            <br><br>
            Due to Facebook’s 30 day we-hope-you-change-your-mind policy, it will take a month before you actually stop seeing my profile on the platforms.

                        The birthday feature is one of the reasons I kept my Facebook account for so long. Fortunately, it was easy to use this browser extension to export birthdays into a Google Calendar. I will use this to remind me to reach out on your special day :)

                        No, it was exceedingly challenging. To begin, finding the “Delete Account” setting was a pain, and, once I did, they encouraged me to deactivate – rather than delete – my account. Even then, I needed to click through three separate buttons to confirm I wanted to go through the decision, then wait a full 30 days in case I change my mind.<br><br>

                        More broadly, Facebook designed a series of barriers that made it hard for me to leave their platform. For example, many of my messages were on Facebook messenger. As Facebook explained, all of these messages will be deleted once my account deletion is processed in 30 days. Coincidentally, if I deactivate rather than delete my account, this won’t happen.<br><br>
                        
                        Facebook also encouraged me to authenticate many of my third party accounts (Spotify, Netflix, etc) through their service. Now that my account has been deleted, I will need to reset all of these logins.<br><br>
                        
                        Other features such as birthdays and photo storage have made the process of decoupling my life from the platform a hassle, but not impossible!<br><br>
